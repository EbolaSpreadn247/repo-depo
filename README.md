might make a nice ref for database usage. duno.

Okie actually, dont README. I'm gonna put notes for myself here.

First I need a generic program with, like, buttons and functions and shit so i can insert database-accessing-attempts into it.
Uhhhhh need fake data. Needs to use objects too. I'll do ew shit cus that seems like it might be easy, I can take a peak at the ew db for help if i need to.

Generic webpage with buttons: Get! Done.
Need to enter more textareas for more values and then make the class for a player-object with all these values as attributes.
Need to try out ajax for connecting to the db. Having the javascript for db calls shown on the website is highly unsecure but i can worry about that later. 
0 users & 0 sensitive data, yet.
